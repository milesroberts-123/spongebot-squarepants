# PURPOSE
Do you often wonder how to have conversations with Homo sapiens in the virtual dimension?
Are you unsure of the proper response when an internet being tells you "Hello!", "Good morning!", or "4206969696969"?
Have no fear, Spongebot Squarepants is here!

Spongebot Squarepants is a simple discord bot written in python that will send random quotes, images, or search results from the Spongeverse! 
Every random message Spongebot sends is guaranteed to be relevant to any conversation and will also provide witty insight that will make your friends think you're cooler than you actually are!
 
Just use the simple commands below to get started!

# COMMANDS
Begin your discord message with any of the commands below (including the `$`) to use Spongebot!

`$quote [character]`	Need some wisdom? Pull a random spongebob quote from a custom database (json format)

`$conch`	Can't make a decision? Return a magic conch answer (Possibile answers: 'Maybe someday.', 'Nothing.', 'Neither.', 'I dont think so.', 'No.', 'Yes.', 'Try asking again.')

`$image`	Need to break unbearable awkward tension? Return a random spongebob image from a custom database. 

`$search`	Need to settle a philisophical debate? Search the spongebob wiki with all terms that come after the search command

# ADD YOUR OWN QUOTES AND IMAGES
To add additional images that spongebot can choose from with the `$image` command, just download the image into the `images` folder.

To add additional quotes, follow the format in the `spongebobQuotes.json` file. Each character gets a separate json array and each entry in each array begins with "q:" for quote.

# THANK YOU
Thank you for using Spongebot!
May you always be porus, yellow, and absorbent!
